Explanation
The provided Python code is designed to perform speech recognition using the Vosk library. It checks for the existence of a model directory, loads the model, and processes audio input from a microphone to recognize speech. Below is a breakdown of the conversion to Kotlin:

Model Path Declaration: The model path is defined as a string in Kotlin, similar to Python.

Directory Existence Check: The code checks if the model directory exists using Kotlin's File class. If not, it prints an error message and exits.

Required Directories Check: A list of required directories is created, and the code checks for their existence, similar to the original Python logic.

Model Loading: The Vosk model is loaded using the Model class, and a recognizer is instantiated.

Queue for Audio Data: An ArrayBlockingQueue is used to handle audio data, which is a thread-safe way to manage data between the audio callback and the main processing loop.

Text Saving Function: The saveText function appends recognized text to a file. It uses Kotlin's FileWriter to handle file operations.

Microphone Callback: The callback function processes incoming audio data and places it into the queue.

Main Loop: The main loop continuously retrieves audio data from the queue, processes it for speech recognition, and prints the recognized text or interim results.

This Kotlin code maintains the same functionality as the original Python code while adhering to Kotlin's syntax and conventions.
